   Lexical Analysis  
   Completed for LASA Advanced CS course  
   Assignment: 170914 
   
One application of computers is the analysis of text.  There are variety of tools and approaches to perform this analysis.  The objective for this Lab is to create a small library of tools that can perform some of the basic tasks.  We will utilize what we have learned about C++ strings and functions to accomplish the lab. 

Functions we will create are; 

Substring count: How many times does a substring appear in the text.  For example common letter combinations may be searched for such as ‘th’ or ‘ing’. 

word count:  The number of words in the document.  Exclude number values. 

unique words:  The number of words that occur in a text regardless of the number of times the word is used. 

number of sentences:  How many sentence in the source material. 
  average words per sentence:  word count / number of sentences. 

lexical density:  The Lexical Density Test is a Readability Test designed to show how easy or difficult a text is to read. The Lexical Density Test uses the following formula:  Lexical Density = (Number of different words / Total number of words) x 100  Other Functions:  You may create any additional functions you deem appropriate.  The lexical density of a text tries to measure the proportion of the content (lexical) words over the total words. Texts with a lower density are more easily understood.  As a guide, lexically dense text has a lexical density of around 60-70% and those which are not dense have a lower lexical density measure of around 40-50%. 

The source text is:  “I was born in Lousiana down on the ol bayou raised on shrimps and catfish mamas good gumbo.  I got the ramblin fever.  Said goodbye to ma and pa.   Crossed that ol red river and this is what I saw. I saw miles and miles of Texas 1000 stars up in the sky.  I saw miles and miles of Texas gonna live here till I die." 

Answer the five questions based on the results of the given source text.  Your program should print this out with ‘cout’. 

1.  How many occurrences of the substring ‘is’? 
2.  How many words in source text? 
3.  How many sentences in the source text? 
4.  What is the average number of words per sentence? 
5.  What is the lexical density?
